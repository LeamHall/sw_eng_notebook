Setting up a static web site with GitHub and Hover
=================================================


Assumptions
===========

  You have a GitHub account, and can do git basics.
  You own a domain name. This document uses Hover, but 
    others are likely similar.
  You can do basic text editing for html.



On GitHub
=========

Your GitHub account hosts your project repositories.
  https://pages.github.com/


Create the sub-project at GitHub.

  github.com/MyStuff  -> Repositories  -> New

  Repository name: 
    The first part is the domain, and the rest must be "github.io".

      example.github.io

  Description:
    Static site for the Example.com web pages.

  Private.  The repository can be private, with the pages become viewable
    when they are published. 

    An aside: Paying USD 4 per month to GitHub, or similar, is a 
      great way to keep private data safe. In case your computer 
      dies, or gets stolen. Maybe not bank vault security, but 
      much better than nothing.

  "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", and "Choose a license"
    Leave unselected for the moment. We can add them manually.

  Create Repository


On your local machine
=====================

Clone the repository to your local machine.

  git clone git@github.com:MyStuff/example.github.io.git


Add a first page.
  Edit index.html, and push up to the repo.
 


On GitHub, in the repository
============================

  Settings -> "GitHub Pages" 
    Under "Source", select the master branche, and then "Save".
  
    Under "Custom domain", put your domain name, and click "Save".
      This will put a new file, "CNAME", in your repository. 
      Do a git pull to ensure you have it.



At your DNS registry (Hover.com)
================================

  Assuming you have the domain already registered.

  In the "Overview", ensure your NAMESERVERS are "ns1.hover.com" and "ns2.hover.com".

  While you're here, make sure your REGISTRATION RECORDS are correct, and your 
    renewal date is far into the future.

  Select the domain, and then "DNS".
    Add two A records, "*" and "@". Set the IP for 185.199.111.153
    Add a CNAME record: HOSTNAME "www" TARGET NAME http://github.com/MyStuff/example.github.io  
     
  Wait for a bit, maybe half an hour. Go plan your new master piece of web-y-ness.
