Linux OS Performance

If I write anything useful here it probably came from Brendan Gregg's "Systems Performance" (https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158)

Very useful site:  https://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html

The book gives Debian/Ubuntu packages to add, but I mostly work on RPM based servers. Here's the list of the tools Brendan says should already be on the box, so you can use it when things go bad:

bcc-tools
ethtool
iproute
kernelshark
kernel-tools
msr-tools
nicstat
numactl
procps-ng
sysstat
tiptop
trace-cmd
util-linux-core
