Go

Go is a compiled language originally from Google and written by some of the people who built C and Unix. The main site is at https://go.dev

Cool things of note:
 - Compatibility promise: Go 1.x code will run with Go 1.x.
 - Easy cross-compile.
 - Fairly easy to write. Well, easier than C or Rust, not as easy as Python.
