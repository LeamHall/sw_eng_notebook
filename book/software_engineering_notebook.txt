Go



Go is a compiled language originally from Google and written by some of the people who built C and Unix. The main site is at https://go.dev

Cool things of note:

- Compatibility promise: Go 1.x code will run with Go 1.x.

- Easy cross-compile.

- Fairly easy to write. Well, easier than C or Rust, not as easy as Python.

Resources:

- The Go Tour. You can run and learn Go in your browser.

Python  Writing a C extension



The "official" tutorial leaves a bit to be desired, it...okay, it leaves a lot to be desired in a tutorial. However, Mehul Mohan does a decent job of laying out the basics.

- Excellent insight from Mehul Mohan:

Python MPI (mpi4py)



Installation:

- Ensure openmpi-devel or mpich-devel, and their non-devel parts, are installed.

- MPI on Fedora:

https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/mpi/

- Insight from @dalcini (author of mpi4py):

https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/discussions/579#discussioncomment-11203978

Specifically:

After installing MPICH and/or Open MPI, please close your terminal and open another one. In the new terminal, load the module of the MPI you want to use and check the mpicc and mpiexec commands are found:

$ module load mpi/mpich-x86_64

$ which mpicc

/usr/lib64/mpich/bin/mpicc

$ which mpiexec

/usr/lib64/mpich/bin/mpiexec
